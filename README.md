**SWE-Together** reconstructs the multi-turn loop from real user–agent sessions, replaying each with a reactive **user simulator** that ask questions, new requirements etc and preserves the original users' intents. 

- **109 tasks**, each a first user message + a replayable interaction, run in a sandbox.
- Pluggable coding agents: **opencode, claude-code, codex, mini-swe-agent**.
- Reported axes: **correctness** (agentic judge), **User Correction** (how much the user had to push back the agent).

Browse the task specs in the [dataset viewer](https://huggingface.co/datasets/yfwu/SWE-Together), or load them without cloning:

```python
from datasets import load_dataset
ds = load_dataset("yfwu/SWE-Together", split="test")   # 109 task specs
```

Each row is a task spec (instruction, repo, base commit, scoring targets, reference patch, user intents). The row's `docker_image` points at the task's prebuilt environment on GHCR and `task_id` maps back to `tasks/<task_id>/` here (Dockerfile + verifier + user-sim prompts) — that's what makes the task *runnable*.

## Quickstart

### 1. Install

```bash
uv sync                  # creates .venv with harbor (editable) + deps
cp .env.example .env     # then fill in the keys you need (table below)
```

Run everything below with the project venv (`.venv/bin/python`) so harbor is importable.

You also need **E2B**, local **Docker**, or the authenticated **Sandoq
OCI-runner** backend (`--env-type sandoq`). Task images are pulled from
`ghcr.io/togetherbench/*`. Sandoq setup, its end-to-end probe, and Slurm notes
are documented in [RUN_SANDOQ.md](RUN_SANDOQ.md).

### 2. Launch run

The launcher reads a plan and drives both stages. It is **dry-run by default** — it prints the commands; add `--execute` to actually run.

```bash
# Preview the full canonical run
.venv/bin/python launch.py canonical_full109.json

# Produce trials for one cohort, then score it
.venv/bin/python launch.py canonical_full109.json --stage run   --models opencode_opus48 --execute
.venv/bin/python launch.py canonical_full109.json --stage judge --models opencode_opus48 --execute
```

Trials land in `trials/canonical_full109/<tag>_r<k>/`; judge aggregates in `results/<tag>/`.

### 3. Optionally, run the two stages separately

```bash
# Stage 1 — agent solves the tasks (one cohort)
.venv/bin/python src/run_eval.py \
  --model openrouter/anthropic/claude-opus-4-8 \
  --tag opus48 --agent-type opencode --env-type e2b \
  --workers 25 --agent-timeout 4800 \
  --trials-dir trials/opus48_r1
# (--dry-run to preview, --tasks a,b for a subset, --skip-existing to resume,
#  rerun with --trials-dir trials/opus48_r2 for a replicate)

# Stage 2 — judge & score (repeat --trials-root per replicate)
.venv/bin/python -m eval.run_eval \
  --trials-root trials/opus48_r1 --trials-root trials/opus48_r2 \
  --tasks-root tasks --output-dir results/opus48 --model-tag opus48 \
  --require-complete --expected-replicates 2 \
  --expected-judge-model anthropic/claude-opus-4-6 \
  --user-correction-source single \
  --tag-model gemini/gemini-3.1-pro-preview
```

The completeness gate rejects partial replicate matrices, infrastructure
failures, missing cost data/tags, and mixed judge models. For a compact Table-2
row, pass both replicate roots to `eval/table2_metrics.py --strict
--u-corr-source single --expected-tag-model gemini/gemini-3.1-pro-preview`;
output without `--strict` is explicitly marked diagnostic/noncanonical.
`canonical_full109.json` follows the released evaluator's single Gemini 3.1
Pro message tagger. The bundled three-model adjudicator is an optional local
ensemble and is not part of the protocol stated in the paper.

## Environment keys

Most runs need only a subset; `.env.example` documents them all. Minimum for an opencode + Opus run on E2B:

| key | used for |
|---|---|
| `E2B_API_KEY` | the sandbox (run **and** judge) |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | user simulator + message tagging (**every** run) |
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | the agent model (or the provider key matching your model) |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | the Step-1 agentic judge |
| `GHCR_USER` / `GHCR_TOKEN` | pull task images from `ghcr.io/togetherbench/*` |

The released U-Corr pipeline uses the Gemini tagger above at temperature 0.
An optional `--user-correction-source threeway` ensemble can compare Gemini
and Opus labels and arbitrate disagreements through the bundled Codex-OAuth
proxy, but its output must be labelled as a separate local methodology.

For Sandoq, also set `OCI_RUNNER_TOKEN_FILE` to a non-symlink mode-`0600`
bearer-token file and run `.venv/bin/python sandoq_probe.py` before a cohort.

## How it works

Tasks are **progressively revealed**, not one-shot. The agent gets `instruction.md` as turn 0; a **user simulator** then watches it and replays the original session's follow-ups — clarifications, course-corrections, reviews — so a score reflects the whole interaction. Each cohort runs for multiple replicates.

Scoring centers on two axes:

- **Correctness** — an agentic judge decomposes each task into *weighted completeness goals* (frozen per task, so scores are comparable across cohorts) and marks the agent's patch against them, crediting near-misses fairly. Rolled up as `pass@1`, `stable_pass_rate`, and `pass²` at a `judge_score ≥ 0.85` bar.
- **User Correction** — `#correction + 0.2·nudge`, from per-message tags: how much the user had to push the agent back on track. The released evaluator uses one pinned Gemini 3.1 Pro tagger; strict mode validates its model and prompt provenance.

---

## Tasks

Each task under `tasks/<name>/` carries its instruction, the user-simulation prompt, a Dockerized environment pinned to a base commit, a `tests/` gate suite, and a reference patch + frozen judge rubric. The launcher's plan (`canonical_full109.json`) lists the canonical 109; edit `models` / `replicates` / `tasks` there to define your own run.
